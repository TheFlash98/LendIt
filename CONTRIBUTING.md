We welcome contributions from anyone, even if you are new to open source. LendIt was the result of a hackathon and we'd love to see it go forward into a full fledged product.

You can find existing issues in the issues tab or you can suggest new features by making a new issue. Don't forget to leave a comment if you want to work on an issue!

## Setup the development environment

## Sending your contribution
We use Git to maintain our codebase. Contributing takes only a few steps -
- Fork our repository.
- Make a new branch (*never* make changes on master!).
- Test your changes to see if everything works.
- Send in a [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/).

Here is a [detailed guide](https://gist.github.com/Chaser324/ce0505fbed06b947d962) for the above steps.

## Join out Gitter channel
Join our gitter channel at https://gitter.im/Lend-It/Lobby where you will find the mentors as well as other contributors. Feel free to ask any questions.
